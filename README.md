## Movie Recommendation Algorithm

This machine learning algorithm recommends the top 5 movies based on a given input movie. The recommendations are generated using collaborative filtering, where the algorithm looks at the movies that users with similar tastes to the input movie have also watched.

### Usage

To use the movie recommendation algorithm, simply pass in the name of a movie as a command line argument. The algorithm will then return a list of the top 5 movies that are similar to the input movie.

### Requirements:

1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. Scikit-Learn
4. Pandas
5. Streamlit


### Installation

#### Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/iamfaisalnafis/movie-recommendation-engine.git```

Install the required packages:

```pip install numpy scikit-learn pandas pickle streamlit```
